# PCOS_diagnosis
An endocrine condition that is common in women that results in irregular menstrual cycles and hormonal imbalances is called polycystic ovarian syndrome, or PCOS. The time-consuming and subjective evaluation-based nature of current diagnostic techniques causes delays in the diagnosis of the illness. A suggested PCOS diagnosis system ensures objective and consistent evaluation by utilizing machine learning algorithms for early and accurate detection. By streamlining the diagnosis process, this technology increases productivity and improves accessibility to healthcare. By analyzing important variables such as menstrual cycle patterns, hormonal levels, and patient demographics, the method transforms the diagnosis of PCOS and enhances overall health results. High diagnostic and classification performance is provided by AI and machine learning; however, for optimal diagnostic value, standardized PCOS diagnostic criteria are required. 

 

Introducing machine learning ensures an objective and consistent assessment of PCOS symptoms, minimizing the subjectivity that may exist in traditional diagnostic. Improved Diagnostic Efficiency: The current diagnostic process can be time-consuming and may involve multiple tests. The proposed system streamlines the diagnostic workflow, providing a more efficient and timely assessment. PCOS is a major global health concern for millions of women, with the current diagnostic process relying on clinical symptoms, leading to delayed or inaccurate identification and subsequent challenges in treatment initiation. Our proposed solution is a PCOS Diagnosis System using machine learning algorithms for a more accurate and timely diagnosis. Tailored for healthcare professionals, the system analyzes key features like hormonal levels, menstrual cycle patterns, and patient demographics, aiming to revolutionize PCOS diagnosis and improve overall health outcomes for affected women. PCOS a significant public health problem and is one of the commonest hormonal disturbances affecting women of reproductive age. The condition affects an estimated 8 to 13% of women of reproductive age, and up to 70% of cases are undiagnosed. We would like to change it by developing this system. 

 Algorithm details:

Data Collection: Gather data relevant to PCOS symptoms, patient history, and diagnostic tests. 

Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and noise. 

Data Transformation: Transform the data into a suitable format for modeling, such as normalization or encoding categorical variables. 

Modeling: Apply various machine learning algorithms like decision trees, random forests, SVM, Naive Bayes, KNN, and logistic regression to train the models. 

Ensemble Models: Use ensemble techniques like XGBRF and CatBoost to improve model performance by combining predictions from multiple models. 

Evaluation: Assess the models using metrics like recall, precision, and F1 score to determine their effectiveness in diagnosing PCOS. 

Confusion Matrix Generation: Create a confusion matrix for each model to visualize true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. 

Training and Testing Data Split: Divide the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) to validate the modelâ€™s performance on unseen data. 

This diagram provides a conceptual framework for the diagnosis system. Each step would require more detailed planning and execution to develop a fully functional PCOS diagnosis system.
